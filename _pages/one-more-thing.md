## Besides academic research, I am also working on democratization of AI and trying to bring the benefits of AI to everyone

* **A content creator**: I have made **30** videos about various applications of generative AI such as speech synthesis, voice conversion, and stable diffusion on a video-sharing platform called bilibili*. My [channel](https://space.bilibili.com/501495851?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0) now has over **7.5k** followers and my videos have more than **500k** views in total.
* **Open-source projects**: I have built a lot of machine learning applications and all of them are open-source. One of my [GitHub](https://github.com/KevinWang676) projects has received over **1k** stars so far. The corresponding speech synthesis [project](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kevinwang676/Bark-with-Voice-Cloning) was one of the Top **20** applications (sorted by trending) on Hugging Face.
* **Entrepreneurship**: I am working on a startup project named [TalkTalkAI](http://www.talktalkai.com/). My goal is to let everyone enjoy the benifits of the development of AI-based speech technology. I have met and discussed with the partners of two venture capital corporations ([Y Combinator China](https://www.miracleplus.com/en/) and [Panda Capital](https://www.pandavcfund.com/f)) about my startup project.

<h6> * bilibili is one of the most popular video-sharing platforms in China and it is often referred to as the Chinese version of YouTube</h6>

## Quotations that I like the most:
**About AI, technology, and innovation**
* *Technology alone is not enough. It's technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that make our hearts sing.* – Steve Jobs
* *Innovation comes from questioning the way things have been done before.* – Elon Musk
* *This question of whether AI is a tool or a creature is something that really confuses a lot of people. And it confused me for a while too. But I now think we are very much building a tool and not a creature. And I am very happy about that. I think we should and will continue in that direction.* – Sam Altman
* *We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.* – Roy Amara
* *Something unknown is doing we don’t know what.* – Arthur Eddington
* *You're about to go into a world witnessing great change. And just as I was with the PC and chip revolution, you are at the beginning, at the starting line of AI. Every industry will be revolutionized, reborn, ready for new ideas. Your ideas. In 40 years, we created the PC, Internet, mobile, cloud, and now the AI era. What will you create? Whatever it is, run after it like we did. Run, don't walk. Remember, either you are running for food; or you are running from becoming food. And oftentimes you can't tell which. Either way, run. And for your journey, take along some of my learnings, that you will have humility to confront failure, admit mistake, and ask for help. You will endure the pain and suffering needed to realize your dreams. And you will make sacrifices to dedicate yourself to a life of purpose and doing your life's work.* – Jensen Huang

**Random topics**
* *Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.* – Steve Jobs
* *Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.* – Winston Churchill
* *Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair. . . . This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.* – Bertrand Russell
* *Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often and steadily we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.* – Immanuel Kant
* *Love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is done well.* – Vincent van Gogh
