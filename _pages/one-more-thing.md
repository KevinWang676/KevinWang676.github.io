## Besides academic research, I am also working on democratization of AI and trying to bring the benefits of AI to everyone

* **A content creator**: I have made about **30** videos about various applications of generative AI such as speech synthesis, voice conversion, and stable diffusion on a Chinese video sharing website called bilibili. My [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/501495851?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0)* channel now has over **6k** followers and my videos have more than **400k** views in total.
* **Open-source projects**: I have built a lot of machine learning applications and all of them are open-source. My [GitHub](https://github.com/KevinWang676) projects have received over **1.1k** stars in total. My speech synthesis [project](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kevinwang676/Bark-with-Voice-Cloning) was one of the Top 20 applications (sorted by trending) on Hugging Face.
* **Entrepreneurship**: I am working on a startup project named [TalkTalkAI](http://www.talktalkai.com/). My goal is to let everyone enjoy the benifits of the development of speech technology. I have met and discussed with the partners of two venture capital corporations ([Y Combinator China](https://www.miracleplus.com/en/) and [Panda Capital](https://www.pandavcfund.com/f)) about my startup project.

<h6> * bilibili is one of the most popular video-sharing platforms in China and it is often referred to as the Chinese version of YouTube</h6>
