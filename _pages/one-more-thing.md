## Besides academic research, I am also working on democratization of AI and trying to bring the benefits of AI to everyone

* **A content creator**: I have made almost **30** videos about various applications of generative AI such as speech synthesis, voice conversion, and stable diffusion on a video-sharing platform called bilibili*. My [channel](https://space.bilibili.com/501495851?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0) now has over **6k** followers and my videos have more than **420k** views in total.
* **Open-source projects**: I have built a lot of machine learning applications and all of them are open-source. My [GitHub](https://github.com/KevinWang676) projects have received over **1.2k** stars in total. My speech synthesis [project](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kevinwang676/Bark-with-Voice-Cloning) was one of the Top **20** applications (sorted by trending) on Hugging Face.
* **Entrepreneurship**: I am working on a startup project named [TalkTalkAI](http://www.talktalkai.com/). My goal is to let everyone enjoy the benifits of the development of AI-based speech technology. I have met and discussed with the partners of two venture capital corporations ([Y Combinator China](https://www.miracleplus.com/en/) and [Panda Capital](https://www.pandavcfund.com/f)) about my startup project.

<h6> * bilibili is one of the most popular video-sharing platforms in China and it is often referred to as the Chinese version of YouTube</h6>

### My favorite quotations about AI, technology, innovation, and more: 

* *Technology alone is not enough. It's technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that make our hearts sing.* – Steve Jobs
* *Innovation comes from questioning the way things have been done before.* – Elon Musk
* *We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.* – Roy Amara
* *Something unknown is doing we don’t know what.* – Arthur Eddington
* *You're about to go into a world witnessing great change. And just as I was with the PC and chip revolution, you are at the beginning, at the starting line of AI. Every industry will be revolutionized, reborn, ready for new ideas. Your ideas. In 40 years, we created the PC, Internet, mobile, cloud, and now the AI era. What will you create? Whatever it is, run after it like we did. Run, don't walk. Remember, either you are running for food; or you are running from becoming food. And oftentimes you can't tell which. Either way, run. And for your journey, take along some of my learnings, that you will have humility to confront failure, admit mistake, and ask for help. You will endure the pain and suffering needed to realize your dreams. And you will make sacrifices to dedicate yourself to a life of purpose and doing your life's work.* – Jensen Huang
* *Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.* – Winston Churchill
