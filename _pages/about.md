I am Qixuan Kevin Wang, a senior student majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences at [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/). Currently, I am working on extreme value theory and machine learning projects such as voice cloning and text to speech.

My research interests include probability theory, statistics, machine learning, and speech synthesis. I am also interested in democratization of AI and entrepreneurship.
