My name is Qixuan Wang, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), with a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences from [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) and [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/). I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Italo Simonelli](https://faculty.dukekunshan.edu.cn/faculty_profiles/italo-simonelli) during my undergraduate years. My current work focuses on speech processing, large language models, and diffusion models, with a strong foundation in cutting-edge AI technologies.

My research interests include probability theory, statistics, speech processing, and generative models. I am also interested in democratization of AI and entrepreneurship. My goal is to let everyone enjoy a better life and work more efficiently through **human-centered AI**. I have made more than **40** videos about various applications of generative AI. My bilibili* channel now has over **14k** followers and my videos receive over **1 million** views in total.

News
======
* **[Sep. 2024]** Started my journey at Northwestern University!
* **[Apr. 2024]** I was invited by [Himalaya](https://www.himalaya.com/us) to participate in a live stream about AI companions. About 1,000 people watched the live stream. See the poster [here](https://kevinwang676.github.io/files/poster.jpg).
* **[Mar. 2024]** I was interviewed by *[South Reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Reviews)*, a famous politics and economics magazine in China, and shared my thoughts on the recent development of AI speech technology. Check out the Chinese article [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YQhRRfltN4B648geubn36A)!
* **[Mar. 2024]** My text-to-speech project [**Bark Voice Cloning**](https://github.com/KevinWang676/Bark-Voice-Cloning) has received over 2,000 stars on GitHub!
* **[Feb. 2024]** We are thrilled to launch our most powerful **AI song cover generator** ever with [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/)! Just need to provide the name of a song and our application running on an **A100** GPU will handle everything else. Check it out on our [**website**](https://www.talktalkai.com/) (please click "EN" in the first tab of our website to see the English version)!
