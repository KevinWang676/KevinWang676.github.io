I am Qixuan Kevin Wang, a senior student majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences at [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Italo Simonelli](https://faculty.dukekunshan.edu.cn/faculty_profiles/italo-simonelli). Currently, I am working on extreme value theory and deep learning projects such as large language models and diffusion models.

My research interests include probability theory, statistics, speech processing, generative models, and electrical engineering. I am also interested in democratization of AI and entrepreneurship. My goal is to let everyone enjoy a better life and work more efficiently through **human-centered AI**. I have made more than **30** videos about various applications of generative AI. My bilibili* channel now has about **9k** followers and my videos have over **600k** views in total.
