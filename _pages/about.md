I am a **Master of Science student in Artificial Intelligence** at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), expected to graduate in **December 2025**. I hold a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences from [Duke University](https://duke.edu) and [Duke Kunshan University](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Generative AI** and **Machine Learning**, with a focus on:
*   **Large Language Models (LLMs)** & Agentic Workflows
*   **Diffusion Models** (Image & Audio Generation)
*   **Speech Processing** (TTS, Voice Conversion)

Going forward, I am especially excited about **AI for batteries and energy storage**: using **LLMs/agents + retrieval** to accelerate battery R&D (literature mining, knowledge bases, reasoning over technical documents), and connecting ML with battery-domain understanding.

I am currently preparing PhD applications to **Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Puyuan Future Technology Institute)** and **Shanghai Chuangzhi Institute**, and I am eager to work with advisors whose research combines **AI and battery technology**.

For my **Shanghai Chuangzhi Institute** application in particular, I aim to emphasize my strong **entrepreneurial motivation** and my experience building and scaling real products end-to-end.
