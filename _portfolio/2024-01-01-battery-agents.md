## Project Overview

I developed a **full-stack multi-agent AI system** that simulates a battery research engineering team. The system integrates **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** based knowledge access to support reasoning, literature analysis, and decision-making over battery papers.

### Technologies
*   Large Language Models (LLMs)
*   Multi-Agent Systems
*   RAG
*   Python
